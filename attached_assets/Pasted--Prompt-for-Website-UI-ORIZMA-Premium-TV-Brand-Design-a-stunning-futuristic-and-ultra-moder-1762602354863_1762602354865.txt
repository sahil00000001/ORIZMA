🌌 Prompt for Website UI (ORIZMA – Premium TV Brand)

Design a stunning, futuristic, and ultra-modern eCommerce website UI for ORIZMA, a premium television brand.
The entire visual theme should be sleek, dark, and minimalistic, blending black and charcoal backgrounds with neon gradients, smooth animations, and glowing highlights to create a high-tech, premium experience.

🎨 Overall Vibe

Visual tone: Luxury meets innovation — cinematic, elegant, and immersive.

Use subtle glassmorphism, micro-interactions, and smooth page transitions for an elevated feel.

Typography should be bold, modern, and clean — something futuristic yet readable (e.g., “Poppins”, “Space Grotesk”, or “Urbanist”).

Use vibrant accent colors like electric blue, violet, or gold to create contrast against the dark base.

Use scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and fade/slide transitions to make navigation lively.

🖥️ Homepage Layout

Hero Section:

Full-width looping video or animated background showcasing glowing Orizma TVs.

A sleek tagline overlay:
“ORIZMA – Crafted to Endure”

A premium “Shop Now” CTA with animated glow on hover.

Navigation Bar:

Sticky, transparent top navbar with minimal icons (Home, Products, About, Contact).

On scroll, transitions into a solid black bar with glowing hover underlines.

Product Categories Section:

Grid-based showcase by TV size (32", 43", 55", 65").

Each category card has hover zoom animation and a “View Models” button.

Feature Highlights Section:

Animated horizontal scroll featuring features like “Bezel-less Design”, “Voice Assistant”, “Dolby Audio”, etc.

Use icons and short animated texts.

Brand Story Section:

Smooth fade-in paragraphs with Orizma’s story: “Built on precision, performance, and trust.”

Include a premium lifestyle photo background in grayscale overlay.

Minimal black footer with white and gold text for contact info, brand email, and social icons (monochrome).

📺 Product Detail Page

Title, model number, price, and tagline elegantly displayed with glowing separators.

Animated feature cards (slide-in animation) — “Built-in Wi-Fi”, “BT Remote”, “Bezel-less Design”, etc.

Section for supported apps with their colorful logos arranged in a glowing carousel (Netflix, Prime, YouTube, etc.).

Smooth scroll to specs, description, and comparison with other models.

Floating “Buy Now” or “Explore More” button that animates on scroll.

✨ Interactions

Page transitions: Use motion fade and smooth direction-based slide animations between pages.

Hover Effects: Glowing TV frames, button neon borders, smooth tilt parallax effects.

Micro Animations: Subtle movement of background gradients, gentle reflections on TVs, and icon animations on hover.

💎 Key Aesthetic Goals

Black-based luxury interface with premium motion design.

Every section should feel alive and cinematic — motion, depth, and lighting effects must stand out.

Make the UI look like it belongs to a next-gen premium electronics brand.

Prioritize visual storytelling and smooth navigation over clutter.
